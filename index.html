                        It all started with an abandoned dog whom we named Magic. Sana pet rescue is a foster-based rescue for 
                        orphaned pets in Edina, MN and surrounding areas. Our mission is to provide care for the 
                        animal rescue organizations and impound facilities to improvce survival rates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We strive for a world where every companion animal has a safe and loving home and their 
                        family has the knowledge and resources needed to give them the life they deserve.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <h3>You can help too!</h3>
                <p>
                    We strongly hold the belief that a home offers a far more meaningful and preferable 
                    environment for most companion animals in need of an adoptive home, as opposed to a shelter 
                    or kennel. Consequently, we heavily depend on volunteers who graciously provide foster homes 
                    for rescued pets until they find their forever homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each pet in our care is provided with routine vaccinations, spay/neuter procedures, 
                    microchipped, given internal and external parasite preventatives, and tested for common 
                    bloodborne pathogens such as heartworm and feline leukemia. Advanced veterinary care is 
                    provided to any animal that requires such services before adoption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note: this means no animals are available at our facility for public viewing. If you 
                    are interested in meeting the animals we currently have for adoption, please visit our 
                    Adoption page.
